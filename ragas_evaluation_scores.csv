The statistical null and alternative hypotheses are statements about the data that should follow from the biological hypotheses: if sexual selection favors bigger feet in male chickens (a biological hypothesis), then the average foot size in male chickens should be larger than the average in females (a statistical hypothesis).

It’s a little odd to talk about just one category\ndeviating significantly from expected; if there are more observations than expected in one\ncategory, there have to be fewer than expected in at least one other category. But looking\nat each category might help you understand better what’s going on.\nFor example, let’s say you do a genetic cross in which you expect a 9:3:3:1 ratio of\npurple, red, blue, and white flowers, and your observed numbers are 72 purple, 38 red, 20\nblue, and 18 white.

Importantly, it yields\nconfidence limits that are not symmetrical around the proportion, especially for\nproportions near zero or one. John Pezzullo has an easy-to-use web page for confidence\nintervals of a proportion (statpages.org/confint.html). To see how it works, let’s say that\nyou’ve taken a sample of 20 men and found 2 colorblind and 18 non-colorblind. Go to the\nweb page and enter 2 in the “Numerator” box and 20 in the “Denominator” box,” then hit\n“Compute.” The results for this example would be a lower confidence limit of 0.0124 and\nan upper confidence limit of 0.3170.

The distribution of a log-normal variable will look\nlike a bell curve that has been pushed to the left, with a long tail going to the right.

However, what if you had 31 females\nand 17 males? That’s definitely more females than males, but is it really so unlikely to\noccur due to chance that you can reject the null hypothesis? To answer that, you need\nmore than common sense, you need to calculate the probability of getting a deviation that\nlarge due to chance.\nP values\nProbability of getting different numbers of males out of 48, if the parametric proportion of males is\n0.5.\nIn the figure above, I used the BINOMDIST function of Excel to calculate the\nprobability of getting each possible number of males, from 0 to 48, under the null\nhypothesis that 0.5 are male.
