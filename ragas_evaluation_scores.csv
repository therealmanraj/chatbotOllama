Importantly, it yields\nconfidence limits that are not symmetrical around the proportion, especially for\nproportions near zero or one. John Pezzullo has an easy-to-use web page for confidence\nintervals of a proportion (statpages.org/confint.html). To see how it works, let’s say that\nyou’ve taken a sample of 20 men and found 2 colorblind and 18 non-colorblind. Go to the\nweb page and enter 2 in the “Numerator” box and 20 in the “Denominator” box,” then hit\n“Compute.” The results for this example would be a lower confidence limit of 0.0124 and\nan upper confidence limit of 0.3170. You can’t report the proportion of colorblind men as\n“0.10 ± something,” instead you’d have to say “0.10 with 95% confidence limits of 0.0124\nand 0.3170.”', 'subtract 10 cm/sec if it has had lizard-slowing disease, or add 20 cm/sec if it has not; the\neffect of gene A might be to add 25 cm/sec for genotype AA, 20 cm/sec for genotype Aa,\nor 15 cm/sec for genotype aa.
