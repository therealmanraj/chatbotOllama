Basics,Step-by-step analysis of biological data,Fact-Based,What is the best way to analyze biological data?,"Follow a step-by-step approach: (1) Ask a biological question, (2) Form hypotheses, (3) Identify variables, (4) Decide on statistical tests, (5) Design an experiment, (6) Check assumptions, (7) Analyze and interpret data, (8) Present results with graphs or tables."
Basics,Step-by-step analysis of biological data,Opinion-Based,What is the most important thing to remember when analyzing data?,"Plan before experimenting! If you think carefully and plan well, your experiment will be easy to understand and analyze."
Basics,Step-by-step analysis of biological data,Comparative,What is the difference between a biological null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis?,"A null hypothesis says there is no effect (e.g., ""Different amino acid sequences do not change PGM activity""). An alternative hypothesis says there is an effect (e.g., ""Different amino acid sequences change PGM activity"")."
Basics,Step-by-step analysis of biological data,Hypothetical,"If error bars in a graph are far apart, what does that mean?","It means high variability in the data. The measurements differ a lot, possibly due to biological differences, measurement errors, or small sample sizes."
Basics,Step-by-step analysis of biological data,Causal,What does ANOVA assume?,"ANOVA assumes that the data is normally distributed and has equal variance (homoscedasticity). If not, other tests like Kruskal-Wallis might be better."
Basics,Step-by-step analysis of biological data,Interpretive,"If ANOVA gives a p-value less than 0.05, what does it mean?",It means that at least one group is significantly different from the others. This suggests that PGM sequences may affect glycogen content.
Basics,Step-by-step analysis of biological data,Evaluative,What is the best way to present your results?,A graph is usually better than a table because it makes trends easier to see.
Basics,Types of biological variables,Fact-Based,What are the three types of biological variables?,"Measurement variables (numbers like ""3.7 mm""), Nominal variables (categories like ""male/female""), and Ranked variables (positions like ""first/second/third"")."
Basics,Types of biological variables,Opinion-Based,What is the best way to analyze a Likert scale item?,"Some people treat it as nominal data (count responses), while others treat it as ranked or measurement data for better insights."
Basics,Types of biological variables,Comparative,"What is the difference between circular, ratio, nominal, and ranked variables?","Circular data represents directions (e.g., wind direction). Ratio variables have a true zero (e.g., weight). Nominal variables have categories (e.g., blood type). Ranked variables have an order (e.g., pain levels)."
Basics,Types of biological variables,Hypothetical,How do you decide which variables to use in a statistical test?,"First, identify what type of variables you have. Then, check your null and alternative hypotheses to choose the right test."
Basics,Types of biological variables,Causal,Why is it important to classify measurement variables correctly?,"Some measurement variables act like categories (e.g., ""yes/no""), while others work like real numbers (e.g., height). This affects which statistical test you should use."
Basics,Types of biological variables,Interpretive,"What is dichotomizing, and why do some researchers use it?","Dichotomizing means turning a continuous variable into two groups (e.g., ""low"" vs. ""high""). Some researchers do it, but it loses a lot of information and can be misleading."
Basics,Types of biological variables,Evaluative,Why does choosing the right variable type matter in analysis?,"If you pick the wrong type, you might use the wrong statistical test, which could give misleading results."
Basics,Probability,Fact-Based,What is probability?,Probability is the chance of something happening. It is written as a number between 0 (never happens) and 1 (always happens).
Basics,Probability,Opinion-Based,How often will you need to calculate probabilities yourself?,"In real life, most probability calculations are done by software, but understanding probability is still important."
Basics,Probability,Comparative,What is the difference between mutually exclusive and non-mutually exclusive probabilities?,"Mutually exclusive events cannot happen at the same time (e.g., rolling a 3 or 5 on one die roll). Non-mutually exclusive events can happen together (e.g., being both tall and athletic)."
Basics,Probability,Hypothetical,"If there is a 50% chance of A and a 25% chance of B, what is the chance of both A and B happening?","If A and B are independent, multiply: 1/2 � 1/4 = 12.5%."
Basics,Probability,Causal,Why do we break probabilities into mutually exclusive combinations?,"If we don�t, we might double-count or miss important overlaps when calculating probabilities."
Basics,Probability,Interpretive,How do you calculate probabilities for non-mutually exclusive events?,Use the formula: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) to avoid counting overlaps twice.
Basics,Probability,Evaluative,When is probability useful in real-world decisions?,"Probability helps in medical tests, risk assessments, and AI predictions to make informed decisions."
Descriptive Statistics,Statistics of central tendency,Fact-Based,When should you use mean or median?,"Use median if the data is skewed, and use mean if the data is normally distributed."
Descriptive Statistics,Statistics of central tendency,Opinion-Based,Which is more likely to be normally distributed: the product of 5 numbers or the product of 100 numbers?,Both will be normally distributed due to the Central Limit Theorem.
Descriptive Statistics,Statistics of central tendency,Comparative,What is the difference between geometric mean and harmonic mean?,"Geometric mean is used for rates and percentages. Harmonic mean is used for ratios (e.g., speeds)."
Descriptive Statistics,Statistics of central tendency,Hypothetical,"If I add extreme values to a normal distribution, what happens?","The distribution becomes skewed�right-skewed if the outliers are high, left-skewed if they are low."
Descriptive Statistics,Statistics of central tendency,Causal,What happens if a variable does not fit a normal distribution?,"Parametric tests may not work, and you might need a non-parametric test instead."
Descriptive Statistics,Statistics of central tendency,Interpretive,What is the most common measure of central tendency?,"The mean is most common, but the median is better if the data is skewed."
Descriptive Statistics,Statistics of central tendency,Evaluative,When is it useful to find the mode?,"Mode is useful in categorical data (e.g., most common blood type) or when looking for bimodal distributions."
Descriptive Statistics,Statistics of dispersion,Fact-Based,When do we use dispersion?,"Summarizing data from a measurement variable requires a number that represents the �middle� of a set of numbers (known as a �statistic of central tendency� or �statistic of location�), along with a measure of the �spread� of the numbers (known as a �statistic of dispersion�). You use a statistic of dispersion to give a single number that describes how compact or spread out a set of observations is."
Descriptive Statistics,Statistics of dispersion,Opinion-Based,How easy is to calculate the parametric variance of a population?,"You can only calculate the parametric variance of a population if you have observations for every member of a population, which is almost never the case."
Descriptive Statistics,Statistics of dispersion,Comparative,When would you use sample variance or standard deviation?,"You might think that if you set up an experiment where you gave 10 guinea pigs little argyle sweaters, and you measured the body temperature of all 10 of them, that you should use the parametric variance and not the sample variance. You would, after all, have the body temperature of the entire population of guinea pigs wearing argyle sweaters in the world. However, for statistical purposes you should consider your sweater-wearing guinea pigs to be a sample of all the guinea pigs in the world who could have worn an argyle sweater, so it would be best to use the sample variance. Even if you go to Espa�ola Island and measure the length of every single tortoise (Geochelone nigra hoodensis) in the population of tortoises living there, for most purposes it would be best to consider them a sample of all the tortoises that could have been living there.In addition to being more understandable than the variance as a measure of the amount of variation in the data, the standard deviation summarizes how close observations are to the mean in an understandable way."
Descriptive Statistics,Statistics of dispersion,Hypothetical,"How common it is to report the range, variance, standard deviation and coefficient of varaition in a work envinroemt when working as a data analyst or data scientist?","In reality, you would rarely have any reason to report all of these."
Descriptive Statistics,Statistics of dispersion,Causal,How can you calculate the range in spreadsheet?,"There is no range function in spreadsheets; you can calculate the range by using =MAX(Ys)�MIN(Ys), where Ys represents a set of cells."
Descriptive Statistics,Statistics of dispersion,Interpretive,Whihc is the most common set of measurement which tells us dispersion?,"A statistic of dispersion tells you how spread out a set of measurements is. Standard deviation is the most common, but there are others."
Descriptive Statistics,Statistics of dispersion,Evaluative,"If the average student drinks 10 beers at a party with a standard deviation of 2 beers, can I say that 95% of students would drink between 6 and 14 beers?","Yes, assuming a normal distribution, 95% of students would fall within two standard deviations of the mean. This is calculated as 10 � (2 � 2) = 6 to 14 beers."
Descriptive Statistics,Standard Error of the Mean,Fact-Based,What is the standard error used for?,It measures how precise the sample mean is in estimating the true population mean.
Descriptive Statistics,Standard Error of the Mean,Opinion-Based,What is the best way to reduce standard error?,Increase the sample size�a larger sample gives a more accurate estimate.
Descriptive Statistics,Standard Error of the Mean,Comparative,Should you report standard error or standard deviation when comparing fox sizes by region?,Use standard deviation for variation within each region and standard error for comparing means between regions.
Descriptive Statistics,Standard Error of the Mean,Hypothetical,"If two standard error bars don�t overlap, does that mean the two means are different?","No, this is a myth. Two means can have non-overlapping SE bars but still not be significantly different. A t-test is needed to check."
Descriptive Statistics,Standard Error of the Mean,Causal,"If I double my sample size, what happens to the standard error?",It decreases�a larger sample size makes estimates more precise.
Descriptive Statistics,Standard Error of the Mean,Interpretive,"What does ""one standard error of the mean"" mean?",It means that about 68.3% of sample means will be within one standard error of the true mean.
Descriptive Statistics,Standard Error of the Mean,Evaluative,"If the standard error is 50%, is it useful?","No, a 50% SE is too large, meaning the estimate is very uncertain and unreliable."
Descriptive Statistics,Confidence limits,Fact-Based,What does confidence limits tells us?,Confidence limits tell you how accurate your estimate of the mean is likely to be.
Descriptive Statistics,Confidence limits,Opinion-Based,Which person has an easy-to-use web page for confidence intervals of a proportion?,"John Pezzullo has an easy-to-use web page for confidence intervals of a proportion (statpages.org/confint.html)."
Descriptive Statistics,Confidence limits,Comparative,"Which is better the �error bars� on graphs or the � number after means in tables represent the standard error of the mean, while in other papers they represent 95% confidence intervals.","I prefer 95% confidence intervals. When I see a graph with a bunch of points and error bars representing means and confidence intervals, I know that most (95%) of the error bars include the parametric means. When the error bars are standard errors of the mean, only about two-thirds of the bars are expected to include the parametric means; I have to mentally double the bars to get the approximate size of the 95% confidence interval (because t�0.05) is approximately 2 for all but very small values of n). Whichever statistic you decide to use, be sure to make it clear what the error bars on your graphs represent. A surprising number of papers don�t say what their error bars represent, which means that the only information the error bars convey to the reader is that the authors are careless and sloppy."
Descriptive Statistics,Confidence limits,Hypothetical,Give me a time where it to be intresting to find the find the size of the effect rather than wether it existis?,"For example, rather than comparing two means with a two-sample t�test, some statisticians would calculate the confidence interval of the difference in the means. This approach is valuable if a small deviation from the null hypothesis would be uninteresting, when you�re more interested in the size of the effect rather than whether it exists. For example, if you�re doing final testing of a new drug that you�re confident will have some effect, you�d be mainly interested in estimating how well it worked, and how confident you were in the size of that effect. You�d want your result to be �This drug reduced systolic blood pressure by 10.7 mm Hg, with a confidence interval of 7.8 to 13.6,� not �This drug significantly reduced systolic blood pressure (P=0.0007).�"
Descriptive Statistics,Confidence limits,Causal,how is the t-value determined aslo give the formula used in a spreadsheet.,"The t-value is determined by the probability (0.05 for a 95% confidence interval) and the degrees of freedom (n�1). In aspreadsheet, you could use =(STDEV(Ys)/SQRT(COUNT(Ys)))*TINV(0.05, COUNT(Ys)-1)"
Descriptive Statistics,Confidence limits,Interpretive,If i use 50% confidence limits what does that mean?,"Setting 50% confidence limits means that if you took repeated random samples from a population and calculated the mean and confidence limits for each sample, the confidence interval for 50% of your samples would include the parametric mean."
Descriptive Statistics,Confidence limits,Evaluative,"For propotions near 50% and n = 50, roughly what would the confidence intervals be within +-?",The confidence interval is within �0.14 (or �14%).
Basics,Basic concepts of hypothesis testing,Fact-Based,What is the name of technique used by biologists?,"The technique used by the vast majority of biologists, and the technique that most of this handbook describes, is sometimes called �frequentist� or �classical� statistics. It involves testing a null hypothesis by comparing the data you observe in your experiment with the predictions of a null hypothesis. You estimate what the probability would be of obtaining the observed results, or something more extreme, if the null hypothesis were true. If this estimated probability (the P value) is small enough (below the significance value), then you conclude that it is unlikely that the null hypothesis is true; you reject the null hypothesis and accept an alternative hypothesis."
Basics,Basic concepts of hypothesis testing,Opinion-Based,What is a good critical value or p value to consider to for statistical significance?,"It depends on what the test, but generally the critical value is around 0.05 to check for statistical significance."
Basics,Basic concepts of hypothesis testing,Comparative,How is Biological vs. statistical null hypotheses different?,"It is important to distinguish between biological null and alternative hypotheses and statistical null and alternative hypotheses. �Sexual selection by females has caused male chickens to evolve bigger feet than females� is a biological alternative hypothesis; it says something about biological processes, in this case sexual selection. �Male chickens have a different average foot size than females� is a statistical alternative hypothesis; it says something about the numbers, but nothing about what caused those numbers to be different. The biological null and alternative hypotheses are the first that you should think of, as they describe something interesting about biology; they are two possible answers to the biological question you are interested in (�What affects foot size in chickens?�). The statistical null and alternative hypotheses are statements about the data that should follow from the biological hypotheses: if sexual selection favors bigger feet in male chickens (a biological hypothesis), then the average foot size in male chickens should be larger than the average in females (a statistical hypothesis). If you reject the statistical null hypothesis, you then have to decide whether that�s enough evidence that you can reject your biological null hypothesis. For example, if you don�t find a significant difference in foot size between male and female chickens, you could conclude �There is no significant evidence that sexual selection has caused male chickens to have bigger feet.� If you do find a statistically significant difference in foot size, that might not be enough for you to conclude that sexual selection caused the bigger feet; it might be that males eat more, or that the bigger feet are a developmental byproduct of the roosters� combs, or that males run around more and the exercise makes their feet bigger. When there are multiple biological interpretations of a statistical result, you need to think of additional experiments to test the different possibilities."
Basics,Basic concepts of hypothesis testing,Hypothetical,"If I have lower significance level such as 0.01, you decrease your chance of an embarrassing false positive?","Yes, but you also make it less likely that you�ll detect a real deviation from the null hypothesis if there is one. "
Basics,Basic concepts of hypothesis testing,Causal,What else can we call a false postive?,False positive are also called Type I error.
Basics,Basic concepts of hypothesis testing,Interpretive,Give reasons why we cannot prove anything in science with examples? ,"When you reject a null hypothesis, there�s a chance that you�re making a mistake. The null hypothesis might really be true, and it may be that your experimental results deviate from the null hypothesis purely as a result of chance. In a sample of 48 chickens, it�s possible to get 17 male chickens purely by chance; it�s even possible (although extremely unlikely) to get 0 male and 48 female chickens purely by chance, even though the true proportion is 50% males. This is why we never say we �prove� something in science; there�s always a chance, however miniscule, that our data are fooling us and deviate from the null hypothesis purely due to chance. When your data fool you into rejecting the null hypothesis even though it�s true, it�s called a �false positive,� or a �Type I error.� So another way of defining the P value is the probability of getting a false positive like the one you�ve observed, if the null hypothesis is true."
Basics,Basic concepts of hypothesis testing,Evaluative,"If we want to evaluate if the age of a person in a class is greater than 25 and we are doing a two-tailed t-test which has a p-value of 0.05, can we say that the test is significant?","Yes, since we are doing a two-tailed t-test, we would divide the p-value by 2, which gives us 0.025, making it statistically significant."
