Basics,Step-by-step analysis of biological data,Fact-Based,What is the best way to analyze biological data?,"Follow a step-by-step approach: (1) Ask a biological question, (2) Form hypotheses, (3) Identify variables, (4) Decide on statistical tests, (5) Design an experiment, (6) Check assumptions, (7) Analyze and interpret data, (8) Present results with graphs or tables.","The best way to analyze biological data involves structuring your research question into a null hypothesis (H₀) and alternate hypothesis (H₁). Use statistical terms for these hypotheses. Identify relevant variables—continuous or categorical—and ensure no confounding factors are included. Choose appropriate tests based on variable types, distribution, and the nature of the hypothesis. For nominal data, use exact multinomial tests with confidence intervals when expected distributions don't fit."
Basics,Step-by-step analysis of biological data,Opinion-Based,What is the most important thing to remember when analyzing data?,"Plan before experimenting! If you think carefully and plan well, your experiment will be easy to understand and analyze.","The most important thing to remember when analyzing biological data is:

1. **Setting Up Hypotheses**: Formulate a null and alternative hypothesis to guide the statistical test.

2. **Selecting Tests**: Choose tests based on variables' types, expected distributions (e.g., parametric vs. non-parametric), and assumptions.

3. **Dealing with Distributions**: Recognize when data are nominal or follow log-normal distribution, requiring specific transformations like log functions.

4. **Confounding Variables**: Control for factors that influence both dependent and independent variables to avoid bias.

5. **Interactions**: Acknowledge multiplicative vs. additive effects affecting distributions (e.g., log-normal), which impacts test choice.

6. **Interpreting Confidence Limits**: Understand they represent uncertainty but are not probabilities, avoiding incorrect statements about results."
Basics,Step-by-step analysis of biological data,Comparative,What is the difference between a biological null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis?,"A null hypothesis says there is no effect (e.g., ""Different amino acid sequences do not change PGM activity""). An alternative hypothesis says there is an effect (e.g., ""Different amino acid sequences change PGM activity"").","The difference between a biological null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis lies in their purpose within statistical testing. 

- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** This is the default assumption that suggests no effect or relationship exists between variables. It serves as the benchmark against which we test our data. For example, it might state that red food color has no impact on toothpaste consumption.

- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁ or Hₐ):** This is what you believe should be true if your data supports it. It represents the possibility of a specific effect or relationship. Using the same example, the alternative hypothesis would posit that red food color affects toothpaste usage.

In summary, the null hypothesis is about no difference, while the alternative is about an observed effect. Together, they guide the statistical test to determine if the data provides evidence against the null in favor of the alternative."
Basics,Step-by-step analysis of biological data,Hypothetical,"If error bars in a graph are far apart, what does that mean?","It means high variability in the data. The measurements differ a lot, possibly due to biological differences, measurement errors, or small sample sizes.","If the error bars in a graph are too far apart, it suggests that either there is a large effect or perhaps multiple categories are deviating significantly from their expected values. Each category's deviation should be considered individually since confidence intervals do not overlap, meaning they can be compared without worrying about overlapping significance. The presence of interactions (e.g., multiplicative effects) may require log transformation to normalize the distribution and interpret results correctly."
Basics,Step-by-step analysis of biological data,Causal,What does ANOVA assume?,"ANOVA assumes that the data is normally distributed and has equal variance (homoscedasticity). If not, other tests like Kruskal-Wallis might be better.","ANSWER: ANOVA assumes normality of data, homogeneity of variances, and independence of observations."
Basics,Step-by-step analysis of biological data,Interpretive,"If ANOVA gives a p-value less than 0.05, what does it mean?",It means that at least one group is significantly different from the others. This suggests that PGM sequences may affect glycogen content.,"If the ANOVA test yields a p-value less than 0.05, it indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis. This suggests that there is significant statistical significance between at least one pair of groups, meaning their means are unlikely to be the same by chance.

Step-by-step explanation:
1. The ANOVA test compares group means.
2. A p-value < 0.05 (5% level) indicates less than a 5% probability that the observed differences are due to random chance.
3. This provides statistical evidence that at least one pair of groups has different means.

Answer:"
Basics,Step-by-step analysis of biological data,Evaluative,What is the best way to present your results?,A graph is usually better than a table because it makes trends easier to see.,"To determine the best way to present your results:

1. **Specify the Question**: Your question is whether genetic differences between American and Princeton elms affect insect damage on leaves.

2. **Hypothesis Formulation**:
   - **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: No difference in insect damage between American and Princeton elms.
   - **Alternative Hypothesis (Ha)**: Difference exists in insect damage between the two populations.

3. **Variables Analysis**: Genetic differences are categorical, while leaf sizes and areas measured in centimeters are numerical.

4. **Confounding Variables**: Consider sunlight or water as confounding variables that may affect Y (insect damage), introducing variability.

5. **Statistical Test Selection**: Use non-parametric methods due to the nature of insect damage data if not normally distributed, considering the sample size and expected distribution."
Basics,Types of biological variables,Fact-Based,What are the three types of biological variables?,"Measurement variables (numbers like ""3.7 mm""), Nominal variables (categories like ""male/female""), and Ranked variables (positions like ""first/second/third"").","The three types of biological variables are:

1. **Additive Effects**: Variables where changes add to or subtract from an effect, such as ""subtract 10 cm/sec if it has lizard-slowing disease.""

2. **Log-Normal Distributions**: When effects are multiplicative and not additive, requiring log-normal distribution due to a left skew with long right tail.

3. **Confidence Limits for Proportions (Nominal Variables)**: Used when dealing with categorical data and requires the binomial distribution approach for confidence intervals."
Basics,Types of biological variables,Opinion-Based,What is the best way to analyze a Likert scale item?,"Some people treat it as nominal data (count responses), while others treat it as ranked or measurement data for better insights.","To analyze a Likert scale item using the context provided:

1. **Identify Categorical Data**: Recognize that each item is categorical, measured on an ordinal scale from 1 to 5.

2. **Use Binomial Distribution**: Apply confidence interval calculations based on the binomial distribution, which yields non-symmetrical limits.

3. **Sample Standard Deviation**: Use sample standard deviation (stdev) instead of population standard deviation (stdevp) as it represents the original units.

The results for a Likert scale item would provide lower and upper confidence limits around the proportion, not symmetrically distributed, especially when near 0 or 1."
Basics,Types of biological variables,Comparative,"What is the difference between circular, ratio, nominal, and ranked variables?","Circular data represents directions (e.g., wind direction). Ratio variables have a true zero (e.g., weight). Nominal variables have categories (e.g., blood type). Ranked variables have an order (e.g., pain levels).","Circular: Not applicable; terms are discussed in context.

Ratio: Not explicitly addressed, but related to proportions in the textbook.

Nominal: A type of categorical variable where categories have no inherent order, such as colors or types.

Ranked Variables (Ordinal): Categorical variables with ordered categories, like finishing positions or color blind counts.

Ranking (ordinal): Another term for ranked variables."
Basics,Types of biological variables,Hypothetical,How do you decide which variables to use in a statistical test?,"First, identify what type of variables you have. Then, check your null and alternative hypotheses to choose the right test.","To select variables in a statistical test, consider your research question (goodness-of-fit or hypothesis testing), data type (categorical/numerical), and potential confounding factors. Use appropriate tests based on these criteria, ensuring they account for expected distributions and handle any skewed data with transformations like log. Always aim to align your test with biological insights and use suitable software."
Basics,Types of biological variables,Causal,Why is it important to classify measurement variables correctly?,"Some measurement variables act like categories (e.g., ""yes/no""), while others work like real numbers (e.g., height). This affects which statistical test you should use.","Classifying measurement variables correctly is important because it determines the appropriate statistical methods to apply, ensuring accurate and valid results in biological studies."
Basics,Types of biological variables,Interpretive,"What is dichotomizing, and why do some researchers use it?","Dichotomizing means turning a continuous variable into two groups (e.g., ""low"" vs. ""high""). Some researchers do it, but it loses a lot of information and can be misleading.","Dichotomizing is a method of reducing continuous data into binary categories to simplify analysis. This practice loses some of the original variability, potentially affecting results by reducing information and complicating hypothesis testing. Researchers often use dichotomization for methods like ANOVA when dealing with grouped data."
Basics,Types of biological variables,Evaluative,Why does choosing the right variable type matter in analysis?,"If you pick the wrong type, you might use the wrong statistical test, which could give misleading results.","The choice of variable type matters because it determines the appropriate statistical test to apply. For example, using parametric tests for categorical or ordered variables (e.g., exact multinomial) while non-parametric for others (e.g., step-by-step analysis) is crucial for accurate analysis based on data types and distributions."
Basics,Probability,Fact-Based,What is probability?,Probability is the chance of something happening. It is written as a number between 0 (never happens) and 1 (always happens).,Probability is a measure of uncertainty associated with events or outcomes based on quantifiable parameters and statistical distributions.
Basics,Probability,Opinion-Based,How often will you need to calculate probabilities yourself?,"In real life, most probability calculations are done by software, but understanding probability is still important.","The context does not provide examples where probability calculations are done manually; instead, it relies on textbook formulas and software functions. Probability calculations likely occur when interpreting results from these methods."
Basics,Probability,Comparative,What is the difference between mutually exclusive and non-mutually exclusive probabilities?,"Mutually exclusive events cannot happen at the same time (e.g., rolling a 3 or 5 on one die roll). Non-mutually exclusive events can happen together (e.g., being both tall and athletic).","Mutually exclusive probabilities are those where two events cannot occur simultaneously; if one happens, the other cannot. Non-mutually exclusive probabilities allow for both events to happen at the same time. For example, rolling a die: getting an even number (mutually exclusive with odd) and getting 2 (non-exclusive)."
Basics,Probability,Hypothetical,"If there is a 50% chance of A and a 25% chance of B, what is the chance of both A and B happening?","If A and B are independent, multiply: 1/2 ï¿½ 1/4 = 12.5%.","The chance of both A and B happening, assuming independence, is calculated as 50% * 25% = 12.5%.

Answer: 12.5%"
Basics,Probability,Causal,Why do we break probabilities into mutually exclusive combinations?,"If we donï¿½t, we might double-count or miss important overlaps when calculating probabilities.","We break probabilities into mutually exclusive combinations when testing goodness-of-fit to handle multiple categories. This approach isolates deviations by examining each category individually, preventing confusion and ensuring each possibility is assessed separately for accuracy.

Answer: We break probabilities into mutually exclusive combinations to evaluate deviations in individual categories without overcomplicating the relationships, thus accurately identifying where observed data differs from expectations across all possibilities."
Basics,Probability,Interpretive,How do you calculate probabilities for non-mutually exclusive events?,Use the formula: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) to avoid counting overlaps twice.,"To calculate probabilities for non-mutually exclusive events, you examine each category individually to detect significant deviations from expected values. For example, in a genetic cross with expected ratios like 9:3:3:1, observe if any category deviates significantly from expected proportions, especially when one is above and another below. Additionally, using confidence intervals (e.g., Pezzullo's method) provides a range to assess deviations for nominal data."
Basics,Probability,Evaluative,When is probability useful in real-world decisions?,"Probability helps in medical tests, risk assessments, and AI predictions to make informed decisions.","Probability is useful in real-world decisions through systematic analysis of biological data. It helps determine experimental designs, hypothesis testing, select appropriate statistical tests, ensure data normality, control confounding variables, assess deviations from expected distributions, calculate confidence limits, and report findings accurately."
Descriptive Statistics,Statistics of central tendency,Fact-Based,When should you use mean or median?,"Use median if the data is skewed, and use mean if the data is normally distributed.","The query asks when to use mean or median as methods for determining central tendency measures. The context provided discusses statistics like confidence intervals, standard deviation, variance, gene effects, and distributions but doesn't directly address choosing between mean and median.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Central Tendency:** The question is about deciding which measure (mean or median) to use for a given data set.
2. **Symmetric Distribution:** If the distribution is symmetric (like normal distribution), the mean is often better as it accurately reflects central tendency.
3. **Skewed Distribution:** For skewed data, the median is more robust and less affected by outliers, making it a better choice for central tendency.

**Answer:**

When determining central tendency, use the **mean** in normally distributed symmetric data and the **median** when dealing with skewed or outlier-prone distributions."
Descriptive Statistics,Statistics of central tendency,Opinion-Based,Which is more likely to be normally distributed: the product of 5 numbers or the product of 100 numbers?,Both will be normally distributed due to the Central Limit Theorem.,"The product of 5 numbers is less likely to follow a normal distribution than the product of 100 numbers because it involves fewer data points, leading to greater variability. However, as the number of factors increases, the Central Limit Theorem suggests that the product tends toward normality.

Answer: The product of 100 numbers is more likely to be normally distributed due to the Central Limit Theorem's tendency towards normality with increasing sample size."
Descriptive Statistics,Statistics of central tendency,Comparative,What is the difference between geometric mean and harmonic mean?,"Geometric mean is used for rates and percentages. Harmonic mean is used for ratios (e.g., speeds).","The geometric mean is calculated as the nth root of the product of n numbers, often used for rates or proportions. The harmonic mean is computed by dividing the number of observations (n) by the sum of their reciprocals and uses these to measure central tendency in datasets where variables interact multiplicatively, like speed effects.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Geometric Mean**: Calculated as the nth root of the product of n numbers.
2. **Harmonic Mean**: Computed by dividing n by the sum of reciprocals.
3. Both are used in specific statistical contexts based on data type and analysis needs.

Answer: Geometric mean is found by multiplying all values and taking the nth root, while harmonic mean divides n by the sum of reciprocals. They differ in their application, especially with rates or interactions."
Descriptive Statistics,Statistics of central tendency,Hypothetical,"If I add extreme values to a normal distribution, what happens?","The distribution becomes skewedï¿½right-skewed if the outliers are high, left-skewed if they are low.","When you add extreme values (outliers) to a normal distribution, the resulting distribution tends to deviate from normality. These outliers can distort the shape of the distribution, reducing its normality and affecting statistical analyses.

Answer: Adding extreme values can lead to reduced normality, as these outliers disrupt the expected frequency distribution."
Descriptive Statistics,Statistics of central tendency,Causal,What happens if a variable does not fit a normal distribution?,"Parametric tests may not work, and you might need a non-parametric test instead.","If a variable doesn't fit a normal distribution, certain statistical methods may not perform well or give inaccurate results. You can use exact tests like the goodness-of-fit test for multinomial data or look at deviances from expected proportions. For example, if you have too many or few counts in categories, you might need to adjust your approach.

Also, confounding variables can trick relationships between variables by causing variation that makes it hard to discern a true relationship. You should check each category's deviation and consider how they interact multiplicatively rather than additively."
Descriptive Statistics,Statistics of central tendency,Interpretive,What is the most common measure of central tendency?,"The mean is most common, but the median is better if the data is skewed.","The most common measures of central tendency include mean, median, and mode, which are frequently used in statistical analysis."
Descriptive Statistics,Statistics of central tendency,Evaluative,When is it useful to find the mode?,"Mode is useful in categorical data (e.g., most common blood type) or when looking for bimodal distributions.","The mode is useful when identifying the most frequent category in a dataset, particularly with nominal data where frequency tells us the category that occurs the most. It's helpful in identifying trends over time and can be used even if there's significant variation among categories.

Answer: The mode is useful for identifying the most frequent category in datasets, especially with nominal variables, providing insights into trends and variability when all other measures are less informative."
Descriptive Statistics,Statistics of dispersion,Fact-Based,When do we use dispersion?,"Summarizing data from a measurement variable requires a number that represents the ï¿½middleï¿½ of a set of numbers (known as a ï¿½statistic of central tendencyï¿½ or ï¿½statistic of locationï¿½), along with a measure of the ï¿½spreadï¿½ of the numbers (known as a ï¿½statistic of dispersionï¿½). You use a statistic of dispersion to give a single number that describes how compact or spread out a set of observations is.","Dispersion is used in statistics when multiple variables are combined by adding or subtracting their effects, leading the resulting distribution to become normally distributed according to the Central Limit Theorem."
Descriptive Statistics,Statistics of dispersion,Opinion-Based,How easy is to calculate the parametric variance of a population?,"You can only calculate the parametric variance of a population if you have observations for every member of a population, which is almost never the case.","Calculating parametric variance involves finding the squared standard deviation. If you have the standard deviation values, simply square them to obtain the variance."
Descriptive Statistics,Statistics of dispersion,Comparative,When would you use sample variance or standard deviation?,"You might think that if you set up an experiment where you gave 10 guinea pigs little argyle sweaters, and you measured the body temperature of all 10 of them, that you should use the parametric variance and not the sample variance. You would, after all, have the body temperature of the entire population of guinea pigs wearing argyle sweaters in the world. However, for statistical purposes you should consider your sweater-wearing guinea pigs to be a sample of all the guinea pigs in the world who could have worn an argyle sweater, so it would be best to use the sample variance. Even if you go to Espaï¿½ola Island and measure the length of every single tortoise (Geochelone nigra hoodensis) in the population of tortoises living there, for most purposes it would be best to consider them a sample of all the tortoises that could have been living there.In addition to being more understandable than the variance as a measure of the amount of variation in the data, the standard deviation summarizes how close observations are to the mean in an understandable way.","Sample variance and standard deviation are typically used when dealing with individual variables that may not follow a normal distribution, especially in contexts where the sum of these variables becomes normally distributed. They quantify variability around an average value.

Confidence intervals for proportions (binomial data) can be calculated using formulas from Chapter 14 of the handbook, particularly useful for nominal variables like colorblindness. However, when interactions result in a log-normal distribution due to multiplicative effects, transforming the variable by taking its logarithm yields a normal distribution, allowing for easier analysis.

When calculating confidence intervals for proportions or differences, exact methods are used (Section 14.2). For example, using the exact multinomial test (Chapter 15) with more than two categories and adjusting post hoc testing when significant results are found (Section 15.3)."
Descriptive Statistics,Statistics of dispersion,Hypothetical,"How common it is to report the range, variance, standard deviation and coefficient of varaition in a work envinroemt when working as a data analyst or data scientist?","In reality, you would rarely have any reason to report all of these.","The statistics discussed—variance, standard deviation, confidence limits, and range—are important but may not be the primary focus when reporting in a data analysis environment. Range is related to other sections on distributions, while confidence limits are more about proportions. Coefficients of variation discuss variability relative to mean, which might relate to others in distribution contexts but aren't highlighted here. Data types (nominal, interval) and specific tests ( goodness-of-fit) are mentioned but don’t directly involve these measures."
Descriptive Statistics,Statistics of dispersion,Causal,How can you calculate the range in spreadsheet?,"There is no range function in spreadsheets; you can calculate the range by using =MAX(Ys)ï¿½MIN(Ys), where Ys represents a set of cells.","Based on the provided context, I don't find any section discussing how to calculate ranges in spreadsheets. The context covers topics related to statistics and data analysis, such as post hoc tests and confidence intervals for proportions. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct method for calculating ranges from the given information. If you're referring to something else, please clarify."
Descriptive Statistics,Statistics of dispersion,Interpretive,Whihc is the most common set of measurement which tells us dispersion?,"A statistic of dispersion tells you how spread out a set of measurements is. Standard deviation is the most common, but there are others.","The most common set of measurements that tells us dispersion is the standard deviation.

Standard deviation measures the amount of variability or spread from the mean. It's the key statistic for understanding how data points are distributed around the average."
Descriptive Statistics,Statistics of dispersion,Evaluative,"If the average student drinks 10 beers at a party with a standard deviation of 2 beers, can I say that 95% of students would drink between 6 and 14 beers?","Yes, assuming a normal distribution, 95% of students would fall within two standard deviations of the mean. This is calculated as 10 ï¿½ (2 ï¿½ 2) = 6 to 14 beers.","Without knowing the sample size or the distribution pattern, we cannot confirm that 95% of students drink between 6 and 14 beers at the party."
Descriptive Statistics,Standard Error of the Mean,Fact-Based,What is the standard error used for?,It measures how precise the sample mean is in estimating the true population mean.,The standard error of the mean estimates how accurate your sample's mean is likely to be compared to the population's mean.
Descriptive Statistics,Standard Error of the Mean,Opinion-Based,What is the best way to reduce standard error?,Increase the sample sizeï¿½a larger sample gives a more accurate estimate.,"To reduce standard error, subtract 10 cm/sec if the lizard-slowing disease is present (to slow tortoises), and add 20 cm/sec otherwise (to speed them up). This adjustment can help align the data with normal distributions suitable for statistical analysis."
Descriptive Statistics,Standard Error of the Mean,Comparative,Should you report standard error or standard deviation when comparing fox sizes by region?,Use standard deviation for variation within each region and standard error for comparing means between regions.,"If unsure, state that you don't know. Be concise and factual (max 3 sentences)."
Descriptive Statistics,Standard Error of the Mean,Hypothetical,"If two standard error bars donï¿½t overlap, does that mean the two means are different?","No, this is a myth. Two means can have non-overlapping SE bars but still not be significantly different. A t-test is needed to check.","If two confidence intervals don’t overlap, it typically indicates that the two means are significantly different at a 95% confidence level (standard error method). However, this can vary based on the type of data and how confident you are in your estimates."
Descriptive Statistics,Standard Error of the Mean,Causal,"If I double my sample size, what happens to the standard error?",It decreasesï¿½a larger sample size makes estimates more precise.,"When the sample size doubles, the standard error typically decreases. This is because larger samples provide more data points, reducing the variability of the estimate and making the statistic (e.g., mean) closer to the true population parameter. Mathematically, this relationship shows that the standard error (SE) is inversely proportional to the square root of the sample size (n): SE = σ / sqrt(n). Thus, with a larger n, the denominator becomes sqrt(2n), leading to an overall decrease in standard error.

Answer:
The standard error decreases when the sample size doubles because more data points provide greater precision."
Descriptive Statistics,Standard Error of the Mean,Interpretive,"What does ""one standard error of the mean"" mean?",It means that about 68.3% of sample means will be within one standard error of the true mean.,"One standard error of the mean is calculated as the square root of the sample variance divided by (N - 1), which is often referred to as the unbiased estimator."
Descriptive Statistics,Standard Error of the Mean,Evaluative,"If the standard error is 50%, is it useful?","No, a 50% SE is too large, meaning the estimate is very uncertain and unreliable.","A standard error of 50% indicates a significant level of variability in an estimate, which can be meaningful depending on the context. While it suggests uncertainty around the point estimate, its usefulness depends on whether it reflects real-world variation or is merely due to sample size or data variability. A high standard error could make small deviations statistically insignificant and might be more useful in imprecise contexts where estimates are tightly clustered. Therefore, whether it's useful isn't solely determined by a 50% standard error but also by the specific research question and context."
Descriptive Statistics,Confidence limits,Fact-Based,What does confidence limits tells us?,Confidence limits tell you how accurate your estimate of the mean is likely to be.,"Confidence limits indicate a range within which a population parameter is estimated to lie, accounting for sampling variability."
Descriptive Statistics,Confidence limits,Opinion-Based,Which person has an easy-to-use web page for confidence intervals of a proportion?,John Pezzullo has an easy-to-use web page for confidence intervals of a proportion (statpages.org/confint.html).,"John Pezzullo has an easy-to-use web page, ""Confidence limits (statpages.org/confint.html)"", which explains how to calculate confidence intervals for proportions using the binomial distribution."
Descriptive Statistics,Confidence limits,Comparative,"Which is better the ï¿½error barsï¿½ on graphs or the ï¿½ number after means in tables represent the standard error of the mean, while in other papers they represent 95% confidence intervals.","I prefer 95% confidence intervals. When I see a graph with a bunch of points and error bars representing means and confidence intervals, I know that most (95%) of the error bars include the parametric means. When the error bars are standard errors of the mean, only about two-thirds of the bars are expected to include the parametric means; I have to mentally double the bars to get the approximate size of the 95% confidence interval (because tï¿½0.05) is approximately 2 for all but very small values of n). Whichever statistic you decide to use, be sure to make it clear what the error bars on your graphs represent. A surprising number of papers donï¿½t say what their error bars represent, which means that the only information the error bars convey to the reader is that the authors are careless and sloppy.","In this query, Sally's step count data uses 95% confidence intervals for analysis, which are explained in the context as representing standard errors of the mean rather than specific error bars on graphs."
Descriptive Statistics,Confidence limits,Hypothetical,Give me a time where it to be intresting to find the find the size of the effect rather than wether it existis?,"For example, rather than comparing two means with a two-sample tï¿½test, some statisticians would calculate the confidence interval of the difference in the means. This approach is valuable if a small deviation from the null hypothesis would be uninteresting, when youï¿½re more interested in the size of the effect rather than whether it exists. For example, if youï¿½re doing final testing of a new drug that youï¿½re confident will have some effect, youï¿½d be mainly interested in estimating how well it worked, and how confident you were in the size of that effect. Youï¿½d want your result to be ï¿½This drug reduced systolic blood pressure by 10.7 mm Hg, with a confidence interval of 7.8 to 13.6,ï¿½ not ï¿½This drug significantly reduced systolic blood pressure (P=0.0007).ï¿½","It’s helpful to consider effect size beyond significance, especially for nominal data, as it can reveal whether effects are meaningful (large enough) and not just statistically significant. For example, when analyzing proportions with confidence intervals, you can assess if the difference between groups is large enough to matter."
Descriptive Statistics,Confidence limits,Causal,how is the t-value determined aslo give the formula used in a spreadsheet.,"The t-value is determined by the probability (0.05 for a 95% confidence interval) and the degrees of freedom (nï¿½1). In aspreadsheet, you could use =(STDEV(Ys)/SQRT(COUNT(Ys)))*TINV(0.05, COUNT(Ys)-1)","To determine the t-value when performing a statistical test in Excel or Calc, follow these steps:

1. **Organize Data**: Ensure your data is split into two groups for comparison.

2. **Calculate Means**: Compute the mean (average) of each group using Excel's AVERAGE function.

3. **Standard Deviations**: Use STDEVP for population standard deviation or STDEV for sample standard deviation for each group.

4. **Difference in Means**: Subtract the mean of one group from the other to find the difference.

5. **Pooled Variance (if equal variances)**: Compute it as [(n1-1)σ₁² + (n2-1)σ₂²] / (n1+n2-2), where n is the sample size, and σ² is variance.

6. **Degrees of Freedom**: Use n1 + n2 - 2 for equal variances or a separate formula for unequal variances.

7. **t-value Formula**: t = (x̄₁ - x̄₂) / sqrt(pooled_var*(1/n₁ + 1/n₂)).

8. **P-value**: Use T.DIST to find the p-value, assuming two-tailed test: p = T.DIST(t, degrees of freedom, 2).

**Note**: Ensure your data is correctly split into groups and use appropriate functions for population vs sample standard deviations. Excel's built-in functions simplify calculations significantly."
Descriptive Statistics,Confidence limits,Interpretive,If i use 50% confidence limits what does that mean?,"Setting 50% confidence limits means that if you took repeated random samples from a population and calculated the mean and confidence limits for each sample, the confidence interval for 50% of your samples would include the parametric mean.","Confidence limits indicate the range within which a parameter likely falls based on sample data, with a specified level of confidence. For instance, a 50% confidence limit suggests there's a 50% chance (or more accurately, a 1 - 0.5 probability) that the true value lies within those limits. However, it's important to note that while 95% is commonly used for broader applications, 50% might refer to specific contexts or less common scenarios. The choice of confidence level affects the precision and certainty associated with the interval. Lower confidence levels result in narrower intervals but offer more precise results."
Descriptive Statistics,Confidence limits,Evaluative,"For propotions near 50% and n = 50, roughly what would the confidence intervals be within +-?",The confidence interval is within ï¿½0.14 (or ï¿½14%).,"For proportions near 50% and a sample size of n=50, using an exact binomial test (like in the provided context) allows calculation of the P-value. However, the confidence intervals derived from this method are not symmetric around the proportion like those calculated by normal approximations. Therefore, while exact calculations can be performed with software, they do not provide ± values within a simple range due to asymmetry."
Basics,Basic concepts of hypothesis testing,Fact-Based,What is the name of technique used by biologists?,"The technique used by the vast majority of biologists, and the technique that most of this handbook describes, is sometimes called ï¿½frequentistï¿½ or ï¿½classicalï¿½ statistics. It involves testing a null hypothesis by comparing the data you observe in your experiment with the predictions of a null hypothesis. You estimate what the probability would be of obtaining the observed results, or something more extreme, if the null hypothesis were true. If this estimated probability (the P value) is small enough (below the significance value), then you conclude that it is unlikely that the null hypothesis is true; you reject the null hypothesis and accept an alternative hypothesis.","The provided context does not mention a specific biological technique used by biologists, as it focuses more on statistical concepts related to means and variances. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer based on the information given.

**Answer:**

Based on the provided context, there is no specific biological technique mentioned that is taught or commonly used in biology. The information focuses on statistics related to estimating means and variances rather than specific techniques."
Basics,Basic concepts of hypothesis testing,Opinion-Based,What is a good critical value or p value to consider to for statistical significance?,"It depends on what the test, but generally the critical value is around 0.05 to check for statistical significance.","To determine the appropriate critical value or p-value for statistical significance, consult the provided reference."
Basics,Basic concepts of hypothesis testing,Comparative,How is Biological vs. statistical null hypotheses different?,"It is important to distinguish between biological null and alternative hypotheses and statistical null and alternative hypotheses. ï¿½Sexual selection by females has caused male chickens to evolve bigger feet than femalesï¿½ is a biological alternative hypothesis; it says something about biological processes, in this case sexual selection. ï¿½Male chickens have a different average foot size than femalesï¿½ is a statistical alternative hypothesis; it says something about the numbers, but nothing about what caused those numbers to be different. The biological null and alternative hypotheses are the first that you should think of, as they describe something interesting about biology; they are two possible answers to the biological question you are interested in (ï¿½What affects foot size in chickens?ï¿½). The statistical null and alternative hypotheses are statements about the data that should follow from the biological hypotheses: if sexual selection favors bigger feet in male chickens (a biological hypothesis), then the average foot size in male chickens should be larger than the average in females (a statistical hypothesis). If you reject the statistical null hypothesis, you then have to decide whether thatï¿½s enough evidence that you can reject your biological null hypothesis. For example, if you donï¿½t find a significant difference in foot size between male and female chickens, you could conclude ï¿½There is no significant evidence that sexual selection has caused male chickens to have bigger feet.ï¿½ If you do find a statistically significant difference in foot size, that might not be enough for you to conclude that sexual selection caused the bigger feet; it might be that males eat more, or that the bigger feet are a developmental byproduct of the roostersï¿½ combs, or that males run around more and the exercise makes their feet bigger. When there are multiple biological interpretations of a statistical result, you need to think of additional experiments to test the different possibilities.","The statistical null hypothesis tests for differences or effects using data, while biological hypotheses explain natural processes based on known biology."
Basics,Basic concepts of hypothesis testing,Hypothetical,"If I have lower significance level such as 0.01, you decrease your chance of an embarrassing false positive?","Yes, but you also make it less likely that youï¿½ll detect a real deviation from the null hypothesis if there is one. ","Yes, lowering the significance level from 0.05 to 0.01 decreases your chance of a false positive, making it harder for random chance to produce results as extreme as observed."

Basics,Basic concepts of hypothesis testing,Interpretive,Give reasons why we cannot prove anything in science with examples? ,"When you reject a null hypothesis, thereï¿½s a chance that youï¿½re making a mistake. The null hypothesis might really be true, and it may be that your experimental results deviate from the null hypothesis purely as a result of chance. In a sample of 48 chickens, itï¿½s possible to get 17 male chickens purely by chance; itï¿½s even possible (although extremely unlikely) to get 0 male and 48 female chickens purely by chance, even though the true proportion is 50% males. This is why we never say we ï¿½proveï¿½ something in science; thereï¿½s always a chance, however miniscule, that our data are fooling us and deviate from the null hypothesis purely due to chance. When your data fool you into rejecting the null hypothesis even though itï¿½s true, itï¿½s called a ï¿½false positive,ï¿½ or a ï¿½Type I error.ï¿½ So another way of defining the P value is the probability of getting a false positive like the one youï¿½ve observed, if the null hypothesis is true.","Science cannot prove anything definitively because statistical tests show associations between variables, measured as p-values. For example, a t-test shows if group means differ significantly, but not causally. This is quantified probabilistically, yet conclusions are always uncertain due to confounding factors and variability.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Statistics Don't Prove Anything:** 
   - No scientific method can conclusively prove something. Statistics help identify relationships or associations.
   
2. **P-values as Probabilities:**
   - P-values represent the probability of observing data under the null hypothesis. They show how likely the observed results are by chance alone.

3. **Example with T-Tests:**
   - A t-test detects differences between groups but doesn’t establish causation or provide absolute truths.

4. **Uncertainty in Conclusions:**
   - Even with strong associations, conclusions have probabilistic certainty because other variables and natural variability affect results.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Science uses statistics to find patterns from data but cannot confirm cause and effect with certainty. Always interpret findings probabilistically."
Basics,Basic concepts of hypothesis testing,Evaluative,"If we want to evaluate if the age of a person in a class is greater than 25 and we are doing a two-tailed t-test which has a p-value of 0.05, can we say that the test is significant?","Yes, since we are doing a two-tailed t-test, we would divide the p-value by 2, which gives us 0.025, making it statistically significant.","Yes, a two-tailed t-test with a p-value of 0.05 indicates that the observed results are statistically significant at the conventional alpha level of 0.05. This means there's less than a 5% chance of observing such extreme data under the null hypothesis.

Answer: Yes, the test is significant because the p-value of 0.05 is below the threshold for significance."
